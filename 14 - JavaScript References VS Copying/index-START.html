    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const playerconcatcopy = [].concat(players);

    const playerspreadcopy = [].concat(players);
    playerspreadcopy[2] = "fairy";
    console.log(players);
    console.log(playerspreadcopy);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
        name: "harry",
        age:52,
        address: {number: 99, street:"elm"}
    }

    const harry = person;
    console.log(person);
    console.log(harry);
    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:
    harry.age = 12;
    console.log(person);
    console.log(harry);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    barry = Object.assign({}, person, { name: "barry", age: 88});
    mary = Object.assign({}, barry);
    const mary2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
    console.log(person);
    console.log(barry);
    console.log(mary);
    console.log(mary2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
